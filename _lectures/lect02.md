# Topics

## Simple flow control structures- For and while loops
* Nested and multi-way if-else 
* For and while loops are DIFFERENT in C++ than in Python. We'll discuss.
* Simple accumulator
* Practice with a game of Fizzbuzz in a loop (using multiway if-else within loops)
 
## C++ variables and datatypes (contd)
* Scope and lifetime of variables
* Uninitialized variables in C++
* We will look at three specific datatypes: char, int and string

## Github intro
* What is github? How and why we plan to use it in this class
* What is a git repo?
* Creating a github repo and using github's web interface to store your first program


* Basic abstraction in software: functions
* C++ functions are different from Python functions





We will learn all the above concepts by writing, compiling and executing an example program in C++
